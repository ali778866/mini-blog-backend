      "title": "What is a blog",
      "description": "A blog is an online platform or website where individuals or businesses regularly publish written long-form content, known as posts, on various topics. Blogs can be personal, like a digital diary or professional, focusing on areas such as technology, fashion, travel or health. They often include various types of multimedia like images and videos and traditionally encouraged reader engagement through comments - the advance of social media has killed this part of blogs for the most part. Blogs serve as a way to share information, express opinions, and connect with a broader audience. The benefits of blogging are numerous. They're a great way to build a brand around a business and to generate traffic to your website. From a blog readers can be encouraged to explore the rest of a site, or to take action from a CTA. Blogs can be used to promote product launches and company news, or they can be used combined with SEO to generate traffic and customers.",

      "description": "Jenny Kakoudakis’ interior design blog, Seasons in Colour, equips professional designers with educational content—all within a sophisticated, tasteful and user-friendly site. In fact, it earned an Amara Interior Blog Award back in 2016.The first fold of the site is a full-bleed image of the feature story. The secondary feature appears on a black background, which breaks up the design of the site while calling attention to an article that Jenny is particularly proud of. To monetize the blog, she built a shopping page full of affiliate links.",

      "description": "All the Food is a blog dedicated to all the best places to eat and drink in Dublin. Unlike some of the other websites on this list, All the Food is specifically a blog website rather than a website that includes a blog as part of its content. Readers will find different types of blog content here, such as restaurant reviews, travel guides and neighborhood lists. There are six different categories on this blog: neighborhoods, reviews, restaurants, Dublin guides, travel guides and what’s new. What’s interesting is that each category page is structured differently based on the content type. The same goes for the blog post pages. This shows how well Editor Lisa Cope understands content and that, if you want to create a great user experience, there isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution for structuring your pages.",
